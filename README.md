# Daily Highlight 📖

Get a daily push notification containing one of your Kindle book highlights!

Only your highlights that are set to 'visible' will be retrieved from your
GoodReads account. Note that this does not use the
[GoodReads API](https://www.goodreads.com/api) as this does not support getting
highlights.

   GoodReads User ID by logging in to your account, going to the
   [My Kindle Highlights Notes & Highlights](https://www.goodreads.com/notes)
   page and then copying the ID that appears in the URL (e.g

### Getting a daily highlight

To get a highlight sent to you every day, you can use crontab on a device of
your choice. For example, to get a highlight at
[9am each weekday morning](https://crontab.guru/#0_9_*_*_1-5), edit your
crontab with `crontab -e` and add:
```
0 9 * * 1-5 cd ~/<path-to-repo>/daily-highlight && pipenv run python send-highlight.py
```
